## Locked QC Generation Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every AI agent, generator, reviewer, and automation path that creates or updates a prospect site MUST treat the QC standards below as blocking release requirements. These rules are permanently embedded from `QC_RULES.md` and are not optional polish. A generated site that fails any requirement below is **not ready** for outreach, manual review, owner delivery, or deployment.

### 1. Image Integrity, Validation, and Fallback Rules
- **MUST sanitize every stored and rendered image URL before validation, proxying, or display** — trim leading/trailing whitespace, newline characters, tabs, control characters, and `%0A`-style corruption before using any URL.
- **MUST only accept well-formed `http` or `https` image URLs for production imagery** — malformed URLs, `data:` URIs for hero/gallery images, localhost references, and dead placeholder URLs are immediate QC failures.
- **MUST verify every major image URL actually resolves before approval** — hero, about, gallery, testimonial, supporting, and logo images must return a valid response and render visibly.
- **NEVER count a transparent pixel, invisible placeholder, broken proxy response, blank image, or silently hidden asset as a pass** — failed images must surface as blockers or be replaced with an approved visible fallback.
- **MUST use the image proxy for external business photos that require stable server-side access** — Google Places and expiring Wix/Squarespace-style CDN assets must be proxied before rendering. Approved Unsplash fallbacks may render directly.
- **NEVER store raw `maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo` URLs in final `site_data`.** Those Google Maps photo endpoints are temporary source inputs, not production image URLs; they must be proxied, validated, or replaced before approval.
- **MUST prefer validated real business photos from the business website, Google Places, or validated social sources over stock whenever those real photos are good enough.**
- **MUST use approved high-quality Unsplash fallbacks when real photos are missing, broken, expired, duplicate-heavy, blurred, thumbnail-sized, off-brand, or otherwise unusable.**
- **NEVER use logos, icons, favicons, screenshots, collages, or thumbnail-scale assets as hero/about/gallery imagery.**
- **MUST reject risky low-quality image patterns** — thumbnail dimensions, blur parameters, screenshot assets, obvious logo crops, expiring-token URLs, or other metadata that strongly suggests poor quality or poor longevity must be downgraded, replaced, or rejected.
- **MUST treat duplicate URLs, query-string variants of the same asset, and visually repeated major images as duplicates for QC purposes.**
- **NEVER reuse the same major image across hero, about, gallery, testimonial, or supporting sections unless there is a deliberate business reason and no stronger alternative exists.**
- **MUST keep hero, about, and gallery imagery visually distinct whenever enough usable assets exist.**
- **NEVER reuse the same stock photo across multiple templates or prospects when a unique category-appropriate alternative is available.**
- **ALL V2 preview templates MUST use the shared stock image picker** at `@/lib/stock-image-picker` for fallback image selection. This utility uses deterministic hashing by business name to ensure different businesses get different stock photos. Templates must: (1) import `pickFromPool` and `pickGallery` from the shared utility, (2) store stock images in `STOCK_HERO_POOL`, `STOCK_ABOUT_POOL`, and `STOCK_GALLERY` arrays (not single constants), (3) use `pickFromPool(pool, data.businessName)` for hero/about fallbacks, (4) use `pickGallery(pool, data.businessName)` for gallery fallbacks. Gallery pools must have at least 8 images to prevent collisions. The picker guarantees zero duplicates within a single preview via Set-based dedup.

### 1.5 ZERO DUPLICATE IMAGE POLICY (ABSOLUTE — NO EXCEPTIONS)
This policy applies to ALL images everywhere in the system — scraped, stock, generated, hero, about, gallery, card, testimonial, CTA, and any other section.

**Within a single preview (same business):**
- **NEVER show the same image twice on the same page.** Hero background, hero card, about section, gallery items, testimonial backgrounds, CTA sections — every image slot MUST be a unique URL. If the scraped photo array contains duplicates, deduplicate with `new Set()` before assigning to slots.
- **Hero background and hero card MUST be different images.** If only one photo exists, use a stock fallback for the card — never show the same photo side by side.
- **About image MUST differ from hero.** If `photos[1] === photos[0]`, skip to `photos[2]` or a stock fallback.
- **Gallery images MUST all be unique.** Use `pickGallery()` which has Set-based dedup built in.

**Across previews (different businesses in the same category):**
- **Different businesses MUST get different stock fallback images.** The `pickFromPool()` function uses business-name hashing to deterministically assign different images to different businesses. NEVER use a single hardcoded `const STOCK_HERO = "url"` — always use `STOCK_HERO_POOL` arrays with `pickFromPool()`.
- **Stock image pools MUST have at least 8 unique images per category** to ensure adequate variety across businesses.

**Across categories (different template types):**
- **NEVER share the same Unsplash URL between two different category templates.** A photo used in the electrician template must not appear in the plumber template. Run `bash scripts/validate-images.sh` to check.

**In the generation pipeline:**
- **The scraper MUST deduplicate photo URLs before saving to prospect data.** Remove exact URL matches AND query-string variants of the same base URL.
- **The quality gate MUST reject any preview where the same image appears more than once** across hero, about, gallery, or card sections.
- **The image quality agent MUST check for visual duplicates** — two different URLs that show the same image (e.g., different crop sizes from Google Places) count as duplicates.

**Implementation requirements:**
- ALL templates must `import { pickFromPool, pickGallery } from "@/lib/stock-image-picker"`
- ALL templates must deduplicate `data.photos` with `[...new Set(data.photos)]` before using
- ALL stock arrays must be named `STOCK_*_POOL` (arrays, never single strings)
- The `getPreviewImages()` helper in `stock-image-picker.ts` handles all of this automatically — use it when possible

### 2. Minimum Photo Coverage Requirements

| Category group | Hard requirement |
|---|---|
| Standard service categories | **MUST have at least 3 usable real photos** that can cover the hero, about/supporting section, and at least one additional gallery image. |
| Gallery-heavy categories | **MUST have at least 5 usable real photos** suitable for hero, about, and gallery use. This applies to `tattoo`, `photography`, `interior-design`, `florist`, `landscaping`, `salon`, `catering`, and `pet-services`. |
| Zero-photo prospects | **NEVER treat zero real photos as approval-ready.** Approved stock fallbacks may keep the preview visually functional, but the site still fails QC until the imagery gap is corrected or consciously waived. |

### 3. Hero Image Requirements
- **Every site MUST display a real, contextual hero image above the fold on desktop and mobile** unless that category has an explicitly approved image-free hero treatment.
- **Text-only heroes are NOT allowed by default.** A plain dark or flat hero without a real visual treatment fails QC.
- **The promoted hero image MUST exist, render visibly, and be relevant to the business category, brand vibe, or core service.**
- **Hero images MUST be at least 800px wide, or the URL metadata must strongly indicate comparable or better quality.**
- **The hero image MUST NOT be a logo, favicon, icon, screenshot, thumbnail, or badly cropped asset.**
- **No V2 template may layer a decorative animation, loading animation, SVG effect, particle system, or floating glow on top of a hero image section.** If a V2 hero uses a real hero image, the hero image itself plus readability overlays may remain, but animated or decorative foreground layers must be removed from that hero section.
- **Hero framing MUST feel premium on desktop and mobile** — use intentional centering and cropping, not awkward empty space, cut-off subjects, or logo zoom-ins.
- **If no good hero image is available, the system MUST use an approved category fallback rather than shipping a broken, low-res, or irrelevant hero.**

### 4. About, Gallery, and Industry-Relevance Rules
- **About and gallery images MUST be at least 400px wide, or the URL metadata must strongly indicate comparable or better quality.**
- **Gallery and project images MUST match the business category and the section purpose.** Roofing must show roofs, pet services must show pets, interior design must show interiors, landscaping must show outdoor work, and so on.
- **Gallery-heavy categories MUST use gallery-forward layouts and prominent visual proof, not token filler images.**
- **NEVER approve a site whose gallery is populated with irrelevant, repeated, or obviously generic filler imagery.**

### 5. Before/After Rules
- **ONLY use before/after sections for transformation-based businesses where a real or clearly valid transformation story exists.**
- **Both images in a before/after pair MUST show the same type of thing** — for example, both roofs, both lawns, both bathrooms, both driveways, or both painted surfaces.
- **The “before” image MUST look worse than the “after” image and MUST communicate a real transformation.**
- **Both images MUST be relevant to the industry and make sense as a pair.**
- **Both before/after URLs MUST load successfully and MUST be visually reviewed as a matched pair.**
- **If no strong, matched, industry-relevant pair is available, NEVER include a before/after section. Use a regular gallery or another proof section instead.**
- **After modifying a before/after section, the agent MUST run `npx tsx scripts/validate-before-after.ts` and must describe in plain English what each image shows and why the pair is valid.**

### 6. Content and Business Accuracy Rules
- **NEVER ship placeholder text, lorem ipsum, generic filler copy, fake phone numbers, fake testimonials, unfinished sections, or “Call Us Today” style stand-ins.**
- **Business name, phone number, address, services, and about copy MUST be real, prospect-specific, and production-ready before the site can pass QC.**
- **The business name MUST be the real business name** — reject values such as `website`, `My Site`, `Home`, or any other generic placeholder and fall back to the prospect record when necessary.
- **`site_data.businessName` MUST exactly match `prospects.business_name` unless a documented manual override exists.** Do not rewrite, shorten, or generalize the business name.
- **Taglines MUST be business-specific and category-relevant.** Reject vague slogans and generic marketing filler unless the line clearly names the business or describes a real local differentiator.
- **About copy MUST explicitly name the business and explain what it actually does.** Generic “proudly serving” filler, placeholder introductions, and broadly interchangeable copy fail QC.
- **Services MUST be populated with real or confidently extracted business-specific services, not default category filler.**
- **Service lists MUST match the business category and actual offering.** Reject empty lists, obviously irrelevant services, or generic category defaults that could fit any prospect in the niche.
- **Social links must be preserved or omitted conservatively.** NEVER invent, guess, or swap in uncertain social profiles just to fill the field.
- **Social proof overlays, metrics, and badges MUST use real data or be removed. NEVER invent or inflate credibility signals.**
- **The claim banner and all business-identifying copy MUST show the actual business name, not a placeholder.**

### 7. Contact Formatting Rules
- **A real phone number MUST be present before generation approval.** If no real phone number is found, the prospect stays in processing/manual-review.
- **When a phone number or address exists in the prospect record, copy that source value exactly into `site_data` unless a documented correction is available.** Do not generate alternate formats or conflicting contact values.
- **Phone numbers MUST render as clickable `tel:` links and MUST be visibly formatted as real business phone numbers.**
- **Addresses MUST be present when available and MUST render as clickable Google Maps links using the encoded address.**
- **Address fields MUST be normalized to the exact business address without appended county names, duplicate state fragments, or other redundant geography.**
- **NEVER mark a site as ready if contact information is missing, malformed, placeholder-filled, or visually hidden.**

### 8. Template Selection and Readiness Rules
- **Generated preview sites MUST use the highest-quality category-appropriate renderer available.** If a V2 template exists for the category, the preview MUST use the V2 component. The generic `PreviewRenderer` is ONLY allowed for categories that do not yet have a V2 renderer.
- **Template selection MUST match the business category, tone, image density, and proof style.** If the assigned template does not clearly fit the business category, the site fails QC.
- **Gallery-heavy categories MUST use gallery-forward templates. Transformation-service categories MUST only include before/after when the pair passes all before/after rules above.**
- **A site MUST remain in `generated` or another non-ready state until every locked QC rule passes. It MUST NEVER move to `pending-review` or outreach-ready status while any blocker remains.**

### 9. QC Enforcement Reminder
- **MUST verify both desktop and mobile before approval.**
- **MUST verify hero visibility, image loading, business identity accuracy, contact info, and link integrity before a site is considered ready.**
- **If any locked QC rule fails, the reviewer or automation MUST log the exact issue and keep the site out of the outreach batch until the fix is confirmed.**
