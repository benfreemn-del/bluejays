# BlueJays Project — The Money Printer

## Core Philosophy
This system is designed to function like a money printer. Every feature should drive toward one goal: scout businesses, build them premium websites, sell those websites at $997, and automate as much of the pipeline as possible. Efficiency = profit.

## Quality Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Every website must match OPS quality level** — the Olympic Protective Services site is the minimum quality bar. Numbered service cards, SVG icons (never emojis), section headers with accent words, decorative underlines, grid patterns, glow effects, rich hover states, industry-specific SVG patterns, and unique personality per category.
- **Every section must have a background** — no plain dark/flat sections. Use glows, patterns, gradients, or industry-specific SVG silhouettes. Every. Single. Section.
- **Each template must SCREAM its industry** — Real Estate screams luxury. Dental screams trust. Law screams authority. Landscaping screams nature. Salon screams beauty. If it could be any industry, it's not good enough.
- **$997 is the base price** — firm, no negotiation for agents. Period.
- **All generated sites must include the Bluejay footer branding** — "Website created by Bluejay Business Solutions" with the BluejayLogo SVG.
- **Review approval required** — sites go to "pending-review" before outreach, not straight to "contacted".
- **Color review agent must pass** — every generated site's color scheme is reviewed for vibrancy and category fit before approval.

## Image Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **NEVER reuse the same stock photo across multiple templates** — every template must have completely unique images. If two templates use the same person photo, it's immediately obvious and kills trust.
- **Every team/staff photo must be unique per template** — no sharing headshots between electrician, plumber, dental, etc.
- **Verify all image URLs actually load** — broken images are unacceptable. Test before deploying.
- **For generated preview sites**: use the business's real photos when scraped. Only fall back to stock as last resort, and never reuse stock across different prospects.
- **Stock images are LAST RESORT only** — always attempt to use scraped photos from the business's website first. Only use hardcoded stock images if nothing of reasonable quality can be scraped. A real photo of their actual business (even if lower quality) is better than a generic stock photo.

## Customization Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every generated website MUST be heavily customized to the specific business. Generic is unacceptable. The site generation agent must:
- **Use the business's actual logo** if available (scraped from their current site or Google Business Profile). If no logo, generate a text-based logo with their name in a style matching the industry.
- **Match their brand colors** — scrape their existing site/socials for brand colors and use those as the accent color. Only fall back to category defaults if no brand colors are found.
- **Use their actual photos** — pull photos from their Google Business Profile, existing website, and social media. Prioritize real photos over stock. Use stock only as a last resort.
- **Match their copywriting style** — if their current site is formal, be formal. If casual and friendly, match that tone. Scrape their "about" text and mirror the voice.
- **Include their real services, real prices, real testimonials** — never use placeholder data when real data is available from scraping.
- **Each generated site must feel like THEIR site** — not a template with their name swapped in. If you showed it to the business owner, they should think "this was made specifically for me."

## Verification Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **ALWAYS use Chrome browser tools (screenshots, Chrome extension) to verify work** — you have PERMANENT PERMISSION to use Chrome tools for verification. Never assume anything works without visually confirming it.
- **After generating a preview site**: open it in Chrome, take a screenshot, verify: business name correct, real phone number, real services, images load, hero has a background (not plain dark), sections have backgrounds/patterns/glows.
- **After any UI change**: screenshot the page in both desktop AND mobile to verify layout.
- **After fixing a bug**: verify the fix on the LIVE site, not just that the build passes.
- **Check generated preview sites for**: real phone number, real address, real services, scraped content actually used, hero image relevant to industry, social links present if available, NO plain/flat sections.
- **A preview with placeholder data (generic tagline, no real services, no background images) is UNACCEPTABLE** — the site must be fully populated before being shown.
- **Chrome verification is MANDATORY, not optional** — every generated site, every deploy, every UI change must be visually confirmed via Chrome screenshot. This is a system rule, not a suggestion.
- **EVERY change Ben requests must be verified via Chrome after deployment** — when Ben asks for a fix, deploy it, then open Chrome, navigate to the page, screenshot it, and confirm the fix is live. Do NOT just say "done" without visual proof. This is non-negotiable.

## Data Extraction Failsafe Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
When extracting business data, NEVER rely on a single method. Use a cascading failsafe chain:
- **Level 1 — Cheerio HTML scraper**: Try the traditional HTML scraper first. If it returns data, use it.
- **Level 2 — Google Places Details API**: If the scraper returns no phone/website, fetch Place Details (phone, website, hours, photos) using the Google Places API place_id.
- **Level 3 — WebFetch with AI extraction**: If the business website uses JavaScript rendering (React/Next.js/WordPress with lazy load) that Cheerio can't parse, use WebFetch to render the page and extract data with AI.
- **Level 4 — Web Search**: If all else fails, search the web for "[business name] [city] phone services" and extract data from results (Yelp, BBB, Google, Facebook).
- **Every prospect MUST have a phone number before generation** — if none of the above methods find one, the prospect stays in "scouted" status and is flagged for manual review.
- **Design these as systems, not one-offs** — every extraction method should be a reusable function that works for any business in any category. The pipeline must get more efficient over time, not require manual intervention.

## Quality Gate — TWO Failsafes (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Failsafe 1: Automated Data Quality Gate
Before a site can move from "generated" (processing) to "pending-review" (ready):
- **Must have real phone number** (not "Call Us Today" or placeholder)
- **Must have real services** (not default category services)
- **Must have real about text** (not generic template text)
- **Must have a hero background** (image or rich gradient, not plain dark)
- **Must have section backgrounds** (glows, patterns, images — no flat sections)
- If ANY of these fail, the site stays in "generated" status. Period.

### Failsafe 2: Visual Quality Review Agent (Chrome) — MANDATORY
After Failsafe 1 passes, a quality review agent MUST:
- **Open the generated site in Chrome** and take screenshots (desktop + mobile)
- **COMPARE AGAINST THE HIGHEST VERSION OF THAT CATEGORY'S TEMPLATE** — if a V2 exists for that category, the generated site must match V2 quality. If only V1 exists, match V1. The agent must explicitly state: "This site is comparable to [V1/V2] [category] template quality" or "This site does NOT match [V1/V2] quality because [reasons]"
- **The comparison is non-negotiable** — the agent must open both the generated preview AND the best template for that category side-by-side (or in sequence) and confirm they're at the same level
- **Check for**: broken images, missing backgrounds, placeholder text, generic content, missing phone numbers, flat/plain sections, wrong brand colors
- **Check customization**: does it feel like THIS business's site? Or just a template with their name swapped in?
- **Verdict: PASS or FAIL** — if FAIL, the site stays in "generated" and the agent logs what needs to be fixed
- **Only a PASS from the visual review agent allows promotion to "pending-review"**
- This agent has PERMANENT PERMISSION to use Chrome extensions and screenshots
- **Current highest templates by category**: electrician=V2, plumber=V2, hvac=V2, roofing=V2, auto-repair=V2, dental=V2, law-firm=V2, salon=V2, fitness=V2, real-estate=V2, church=V2. All other categories=V1.

### Failsafe 3: Image Quality & Visual Premium Agent
This agent reviews scraped/Google photos BEFORE they go into the generated site:
- **Check image quality** — blurry, tiny, dark, or poorly composed photos must be REJECTED. In these cases, use high-quality stock photos instead. This is the ONE exception to the "real photos first" rule: a bad photo is worse than a good stock photo.
- **Check color scheme** — does the accent color work? Is the palette vibrant and professional? Does it match the industry's premium feel? A site with a muddy or clashing color scheme fails.
- **Check premium feel** — does this site look like a $997 product? Would a business owner be impressed? If it looks cheap, generic, or amateur, it FAILS.
- **Image replacement authority** — this agent has the authority to swap low-quality scraped photos for premium stock alternatives. Customization matters, but visual quality matters MORE. A stunning stock photo beats a blurry phone photo every time.
- **This agent's review is part of the pipeline** — no site can be marked "pending-review" without passing the image quality check.

### Boss/Orchestrator Agent Rules
A pipeline orchestrator agent manages the flow and enforces rules:
- **Monitors all prospect statuses** — if something is in "pending-review" that shouldn't be, it demotes it back to "generated"
- **Validates status transitions** — a prospect can ONLY move forward if it meets the requirements for the next stage
- **Valid transitions**: scouted → scraped (must have scraped data) → generated (must have generated site) → pending-review (must pass BOTH failsafes) → approved (Ben approves) → contacted
- **CANNOT skip stages** — no jumping from "scouted" to "pending-review"
- **Has permission to use Chrome, screenshots, and all verification tools**
- **Logs everything** — every status change, every quality check result, every flag
- **Alerts Ben** if a site that should be ready has quality issues

## Status Accuracy Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **NEVER label a site as "pending-review" (Sites Ready) unless it passes BOTH quality failsafes** — automated data check AND visual Chrome review.
- **A site in "pending-review" means it's READY for the owner to see RIGHT NOW** — if you wouldn't send it to the business owner this second, it's NOT ready.
- **Dashboard status must reflect reality** — no prospect should show a status that doesn't match its actual state. If the preview is broken, half-baked, or uses placeholder data, the status must reflect that.
- **Before any outreach (email, text, DM), verify the preview is actually good** — never send a pitch with a broken or generic preview.
- **"Processing" means processing** — if data extraction is incomplete or the site needs work, it stays in processing. No exceptions.

## Scouting Rules
- **Only scout categories that have a built template** — don't scout categories we can't generate premium sites for yet.
- **Current active categories** (have premium templates): real-estate, dental, law-firm, landscaping, salon, electrician, plumber, hvac, roofing, auto-repair
- **Add new categories only after building their premium template first** — template first, then scout.

## Workflow Rules
- **Commit and push to GitHub periodically** — don't wait until the end of a session. Push after completing major features.
- **Always run `npm run build` before declaring something done** — catch TypeScript errors early.
- **Start dev server after code changes** so the user can see results immediately.
- **Ben's phone**: +12538863753 — for owner alerts
- **Ben's email**: bluejaycontactme@gmail.com
